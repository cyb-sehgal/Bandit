## Introduction
Bandit is a tool designed to find common security issues in Python code. It scans through code to identify potential vulnerabilities and provide a report with suggestions for improvements. This guide will walk you through the installation process of Bandit and how to use it to analyze your Python code or project.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your machine
- Pip (Python's package installer) installed
## Installing Bandit
## Using Pip (Recommended)
You can install Bandit using pip, Python's package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
1. Install Bandit :

```bash
pip install bandit
```
This will download and install the latest version of Bandit along with its dependencies.

## Using Git (For Development Version)
If you prefer to install Bandit from the source, you can use Git. First, clone the Bandit repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit.git

```
## Then, navigate to the Bandit directory :
```bash
cd bandit
```
## Install Bandit using setup.py :
```bash
python setup.py install
```
# Using Bandit
## Basic Usage
Once Bandit is installed, you can analyze your Python code or project by running the bandit command followed by the file or directory you want to scan. Here's a basic example:
```bash
bandit -r "Your project name" -f html -o outputfile
```
# Generating Reports
By default, Bandit displays the results in the terminal. However, you can also generate reports in various formats such as JSON, XML, and HTML. Use the -f flag followed by the desired format:
## HTML Report
```bash
bandit -r "Your project name" -f html -o outputfile
```
This will save the results in a HTML file named outputfile.html
## JSON Report
```bash
bandit -r "your project name" -f json -o output.json
```
This will save the results in a JSON file named output.json

## Advanced Options
Bandit provides several advanced options to customize the scan:

- **-l** : Specify the minimum severity level to report (low, medium, high). Default is all.
- **-s** : Skip files or directories matching the provided regular expression.
- **-x** : Exclude tests that are not enabled by default.
- **-c** : Specify a configuration file for customizing tests.
Refer to the Bandit documentation or use the ' --help ' flag for a complete list of options.

## Review the report for security issues and make necessary improvements to your code.

# Conclusion
Analyzing Python code for security vulnerabilities is crucial for ensuring the integrity of your applications. Bandit provides a powerful and easy-to-use tool for identifying potential risks in your codebase. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can integrate Bandit into your development workflow and improve the security of your Python projects.
